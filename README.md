Doorbell Mounting Plate

I was replacing a Ring Elite that mounts in an outlet box with a flush mount WiFi doorbell.
I also wanted to angle it slightly.

You can customize the height and width of the plate as well as the tilt angle.

Just use small wood screws to attach the metal bracket that comes with your WiFi doorbell.
